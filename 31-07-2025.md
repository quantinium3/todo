- [ ] build.ts: add function in build.ts to build a single so that serve doesnt have to rebuild the everything and can just call that function.
- [ ] build.ts: add navitems array in grimoire class that would get all the nav items and their redirect paths in a json and those will be passed to the handlebars.
